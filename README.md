# Zindi Projects

This repository contains my collection of Zindi data science projects.  
Each folder represents a standalone challenge, including notebooks, scripts, datasets (or links to datasets), and experiment notes.

The goal of this workspace is to:
- Practice end-to-end machine learning workflows.
- Experiment with modeling approaches across different problem types.
- Track improvements in feature engineering, model evaluation, and deployment.
- Build a clear portfolio of reproducible solutions.
